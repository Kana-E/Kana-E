### Hi! I'm Kana ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer pursuing my passion to make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives. 
Whether it be through enhancing cost efficiency or maximizing revenue to ultimately provide value to the end-user, or creating a savvy product to reach individuals directly, the ability of technology to reach people of all different genres is a huge motivator for me, as it aligns perfectly with my values.

In my most recent projects, I've used full-stack JavaScript with React for interactive and dynamic front-end views, as well as Node.js and Express to create RESTful APIs on the back-end. I have experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB to manage data storage, scaled my microservices on AWS with Docker, and load-balanced with NGINX.

When I am not on my laptop, you can find me outside - hiking, traveling, or walking my shiba-inu!
